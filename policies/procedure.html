        <h3 class="content-header text-center">General Band Procedures</h3>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-5">
            All band members should bring their instruments, sheet music, a pencil and proper equipment (including mouthpieces, reeds, swabs, folder, etc) to every 
            rehearsal and performance. Students should not share music or music stands without the permission of the director.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            There is to be no talking or disturbance during rehearsals. Subdued talking may be permitted with the director's permission or when the director leaves the 
            podium.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Gum chewing or eating is not permitted during rehearsal or performance. However, students will be permitted to eat during 3rd quarter privileges.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            If you wish to enter the director's office, knock and wait for permission to enter. Minor needs should be taken to the section leader(s), student executive(s) 
            or drum major(s).
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">.
            Each student should be seated or standing in formation at the time designated by the director, or the student will be marked tardy. Tardy or previously absent 
            students should place excuse forms/notes/passes on the director's desk rather than disturbing the rehearsal. 
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            While rehearsing or performing during non-school hours, students will restrict themselves to the hallway immediately outside of the band room. Students may 
            not wander around the school, may not go to their locker or do any other activity that may compel them to leave the aforementioned area.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Posture is of utmost importance. Students should avoid crossed legs or ankles and slumping when seated in chairs or slouching while standing.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            The band posting board (just to the right of the band room door before you enter) should be read everyday upon entering the band room.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            While setting up for rehearsal/performance, students should read the whiteboard at the front of the room and place music in the proper order according to the 
            written instructions.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            During the marching band season, many rehearsal/performances will begin with a meeting in either the band room or the auditorium house.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            During concert season, music will be listed on the board in the order to be rehearsed. Music should be placed in order before the rehearsal begins.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Students may not write on the whiteboard or add anything to the band posting board without specific permission from the director. Information should not be 
            removed or erased from the board(s).
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Music folders, stands and instruments should be kept in their proper storage locations. Folders must not be stored (left) on a music stand. When on and 
            returning from field trips, it is imperative that each student takes responsibility for his/her own instrument.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Books and personal belongings should not be left in the band room or in the instrument storage area. All trash should be thrown in the wastebasket. Students 
            should not bring food or books to their seat in rehearsal. Food and drink are not permitted in the band room.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Loud talking, shouting and horseplay are not allowed in the band.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Phone calls and texting are not permitted during rehearsal or performance. Please consult FRHSD/FTHS cell phone policy as it is strictly enforced.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            At the conclusion of the day's event(s), all band members will put their instruments away properly and pass uniform inspection. Students may not leave until 
            dismissed by the director. Plan for this time when arranging a ride.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            At the close of a school day (with no after school instrumental rehearsals) the band room will close at 3:15 pm.

        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            The band will travel to and from off-campus performances as a group, on buses provided by the Freehold Regional High School District's Transportation Department.  Exceptions to this rule require the submission of a form and the approval of the band director and Supervisor of Extra-Curricular Activities.  For this reason, such exceptions MUST be planned with enough time for the approval process (at least two days).  At no time is a student permitted to drive him/herself to off campus events.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            It is the student's responsibility to place his/her instrument on the sidewalk next to the equipment bus.  Bus loaders will load the instruments onto the equipment bus.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            It is the student's responsibility to bring their instrument in off the sidewalk upon returning to the school.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Small instruments (piccolos, flutes and clarinets) may be kept with a student's personal belongings.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Students will be expected to sign a bus attendance sheet once seated on a bus and before departing the school.  Once you have signed on a bus, you may not change buses. Use your real name.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Students are asked to be careful and safe.  If an accident, injury or illness occurs, the director or the nearest adult should be notified immediately.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            While buses are in motion, students are to remain seated.  At all times hands, head and all objects should be kept inside the windows of the bus.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            While traveling, parent chaperones will be placed in-charge of buses.  Chaperones should receive the same respect as the director and be obeyed at all times.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            It should be noted that proper behavior is expected when on a school trip.  Undignified conduct or reckless behavior will result in disciplinary action/suspension from school, dismissal from the band and a failing grade for the class.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Horseplay and screaming/shouting are not permitted while on the bus.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Upon arrival at a destination students should remain in their seats on the bus until given instructions from the director.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Students are expected to keep the bus clean.
        </h4>
        <h4 class="text-center mt-3">
            Conduct of students in public eating places, visiting schools, and during other bands' performances should remain gracious, subdued and courteous.
