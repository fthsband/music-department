                    With an annual membership of more than 100 students, our Marching Band is a musical marching unit organized during the fall for the duration of the football season and any additional
                    scheduled events.  The Marching Band appears at varsity football games as well as other events as scheduled. Membership requires dedication, maximum effort and commitment in all 
                    aspects of marching, playing, and performance.  Rehearsals are Tuesday evenings, Wednesdays after school, and other times posted by the director.  Performances take place at each 
                    home football game (Friday night/Saturday) through the end of the FB season and at various other events in the spring.  Please see the band calendar for details.

                <h4 class="text-center">
                    Band Camp (rehearsals that begin two weeks prior to the start of the school year) is a necessary part of marching band due to the early start of the football season.  It is expected 
                    that all students will attend camp and any other pre-season activities scheduled by the director and/or leadership team.
                </h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">
                    At all marching band functions the drum major is in charge of the band and should receive the same respect as the band director.
                </h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">
                    All students are expected to be in their positions on time, with instrument(s), music and charts.
                </h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">
                    Playing outdoors while not in formation should be kept to a minimum and localized to the practice field.  Students may not play outside during the dismissal period (From final school 
                    bell until the buses depart).
                </h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">
                    Advisors and section leaders are chosen by the director to assist in marching and performance instruction.

                    Right guides will be selected for the parade block formation to ensure proper alignment and distance.

                    Every student will receive <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1__QJfVER9YucA6CMnd5sqQVr6LSM6HkZa3x9fqNqLPU/edit#heading=h.muq8wsffk280">this handbook</a> and calendar of 
                    band commitments.  Specifics regarding these functions will be posted on the band board.  It is the student's responsibility to know this information.  The band board should be 
                    checked daily. A signature receipt form is due from each member before he/she is permitted to perform.
                </h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">
                    Always report (rain or shine) to the designated meeting place for band events (Usually the band room).  Any changes will be on the website.

                <h4 class="text-center">
                    Uniforms will be stored in the uniform closet.  Students will change clothes in the appropriate restroom for their gender.  There must be at least one layer of clothing between the 
                    student's body and the uniform.  Therefore, students will wear shorts and a t-shirt under their marching band uniform.  Under no circumstances are long pants permitted to be worn 
                    under the uniform (thermal underclothes are permitted).  It is expected that all students will exercise good personal hygiene.  
                </h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">
                    While in uniform, students are representing the band, the school, and our community.  Therefore, it is expected that students will conduct themselves in a mature, respectful, and 
                    gracious manner. Students will refrain from any “public displays of affection.” Profanity is forbidden, as is taunting or degrading other bands or spectators.
                </h4>
                <h4 class="text-center">
                    Students are expected to provide black gloves, marching shoes (both available through the music parents) and calf-height black socks.

                <h4 class="text-center">
                    Uniforms will be distributed by the uniform team and must pass an inspection before students are dismissed for the day.

                <h4 class="text-center">
                    Complete uniform should be worn at all times while in public.  <strong>“In uniform” = suspenders over the shoulders; shako on the head, coat zipped, buttoned & hooked.</strong>

                <h4 class="text-center">
