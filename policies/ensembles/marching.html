                    With an annual membership of more than 100 students, our Marching Band is a musical marching unit organized during the fall for the duration of the 
                    football season and any additional scheduled events. The Marching Band appears at varsity football games as well as other events as scheduled. 
                    Membership requires dedication, maximum effort and commitment in all aspects of marching, playing, and performance. Rehearsals are Tuesday evenings, 
                    Wednesdays after school, and other times posted by the director. Performances take place at each home football game (Friday night/Saturday) through the 
                    end of the FB season and at various other events in the spring. Please see the band calendar for details.

                            Band Camp (rehearsals that begin two weeks prior to the start of the school year) is a necessary part of marching band due to the early start of 
                            the football season. It is expected that all students will attend camp and any other pre-season activities scheduled by the director and/or

                            and calendar of band commitments. Specifics regarding these functions will be posted on the band board. It is the student's responsibility to 
                            know this information. The band board should be checked daily. A signature receipt form is due from each member before he/she is permitted to

                            Uniforms will be stored in the uniform closet. Students will change clothes in the appropriate restroom for their gender. There must be at least 
                            one layer of clothing between the student's body and the uniform. Therefore, students will wear shorts and a t-shirt under their marching band 
                            uniform. Under no circumstances are long pants permitted to be worn under the uniform (thermal underclothes are permitted). It is expected that

                            While in uniform, students are representing the band, the school, and our community. Therefore, it is expected that students will conduct 
                            themselves in a mature, respectful, and gracious manner. Students will refrain from any “public displays of affection.” Profanity is forbidden, 
                            as is taunting or degrading other bands or spectators.

                            A student is said to be “performing” at all times during a football game. From exiting the bus (away games) or falling-in in the parking lot 
                            (home games) until you are dismissed, you are performing.

                            Upon completion of the meeting and warm-ups, the band will assemble outside in a block formation. Students will form ranks immediately upon 
                            hearing the drum major's command. All students must carry his/her instrument (no one else's without director approval) and march in the proper

                            The band will march to the stadium in block formation, slowing to pass through the gates. Spectators should not be allowed to break ranks. Do 
                            not engage in ANY conversations or communication of any kind (unless to a leader or authorized adult) while marching to or from the stadium.

                            When applicable, the band will make a “beauty pass” around the track upon entrance to the stadium. Upon reaching the seating area students will 
                            remain at attention until dismissed by the director or drum majors.

                            The band shall be responsible for playing the Star Spangled Banner before the game when at home. The director will conduct.

                        <h5 class="mt-1">
                            Purses and other valuable personal items should not be taken into the stadium. They should be locked in the band office.

                            On warm days it may be permitted to remove shakos. In this event, it is to be taken off and placed to the right of each player (upside-down). 
                            Gloves may be placed in the shako (when permission is given). Great care must be exercised in keeping the shako in the stands. Don't let it 
                            fall in the dirt under the stands.
                        </h5>

                            Ranks and files should be maintained at all times. You may not “visit” another section or a non-band member, including a parent, during a 
                            performance. The uniforms are to be worn properly (see <a href="../dresscode.html">Dress Code</a>).

                        <h5 class="mt-1">
                            Students will be allowed and encouraged to cheer for touchdowns and field goals. However, they should be prepared with the fight song before and 
                            after the field goal/conversion. Cheer with the cheerleaders and avoid unorganized cheering. Section leaders are encouraged to organize cheers 
                            but must seek the director's permission before implementing.
                        </h5>

                            Non-band members are not allowed within the band section. Significant others, parents and friends are not exceptions. Any exceptions require the 
                            director's approval.
                        </h5>

                            Refreshments are not permitted in the band section except during 3rd quarter privileges. Parents may not bring students any food items outside 
                            of the 3rd quarter privilege time. Students are encouraged to make food choices that are non-destructive to instruments. This means avoiding 
                            candy, sugary drinks and other junk food.
                        </h5>
                        <h5 class="mt-1">
                            Students will have the opportunity to use the bathroom while dressing in the school and during third quarter privileges.  Students will be 
                            allowed to go to the bathroom during the game. Students may not use the bathroom during the pre-halftime warm-up activities. At away games, 
                            students must be accompanied by a chaperone.
                        </h5>
                        <h5 class="mt-1">
                            Student conduct should be professional and courteous throughout the time spent in the stadium. Individual playing or “random playing” is not 
                            allowed, hence the term <strong><i>NRP</i></strong> (stands for <strong>No Random Playing;</strong> pronounced “nerp”). Students should be 
                            attentive to drum majors calling stand tune titles. You should be ready with the songs rapidly. Students should always have their lyre and folio 
                            or flip-folder with pep tunes.
                        </h5>
