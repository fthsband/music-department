                        Created to honor the service of Matt ('14), trumpet section leader, and Abby ('19), trombone player and student executive, Basen. Both will state 
                        that they were forced to participate in a band, most likely so their father could one day assume the presidency of the Music Parents. What they 
                        won't say is just how enjoyable the experience was for them both. Both Matt and Abby benefited from being part of the Pride of Freehold Township and 
                        speak fondly of their experiences & the lessons they learned from Mr. Gattsek & Mr. Crawford: the importance of teamwork, the benefits of taking on 
                        leadership roles, and the beauty of creating art. This scholarship was created to serve as a reminder of the many great years that the Basen Family 
                        had being part of the Freehold Township Marching Patriots family, the pride of Freehold Township.

                        This award is given in memory of a great friend of the FTHS Band program, Marvin Cooperman. Mr. Cooperman was an accomplished clarinet player and 
                        was a retired member of the 63rd Army Band and the 50th Armored Division Band. Originally from Newark, he spent his career as a shipping clerk for a 
                        major chemical company here in NJ, but like so many, music is what made his soul flourish. Marvin was a local Freehold Borough resident who for 
                        almost 20 years performed in and with our concert band and wind ensemble. His multi-generational influence and musical talents were a welcome 
                        addition to our band program. Marvin always told me that the quality of students and program we run here kept him feeling youthful even as he turned 
                        70 and beyond. He was one of the funniest and most self-deprecating men I have ever met. He passed away in 2019 after a long bout with illness. May 
                        this award serve to remind us all of how important music is, no matter what career path you choose. RIP Marvin, we miss you.
